# first serious interaction with Git

I pushed my journals up into a git-repository, and I can now reliably push new journals up into my repository. I am having trouble with figuring out how to know which repository that I am pushing/commiting/adding my files too. 

To re-update a Git file, enter the following commands. 

- git add "filename"
- git commit -m "whatever comment"
- git push -u origin master
