# General Reflection

I have been thinking about Walden a lot lately, and how there seems to be cycles wedded to the book, from the smallest creature to our grand cosmos. In a way, it makes the world feel almost mechanical, as if gears are turning and turning to keep the world running. I am not someone who believes the world is a simulation, but there is something machine-like about everything, in the way it ebbs and flows and arises out of these cycles and biological drives. This is hardly a point in Walden but it was born from thinking on it.
