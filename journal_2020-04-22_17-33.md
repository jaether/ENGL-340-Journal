# General Reflection

The TEI code looks more complicated than what we have done before, and I think that is not in the least bit because of the size of the file that I looked at. It is clearly much harder to read code out when it is nonstop and flowing, and it also makes me realize how many things I have to keep in my head to understand the flow of the code. It will be important for me to understand how certain 'containers' are used.
