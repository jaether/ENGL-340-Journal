# things I have learned today 

## general reflection 

I have recently been thinking about the text analysis tool voyant, and am beginning to wonder on its creative capabilities. The use of text analysis, I think, has been mainly analytical, but it would be interesting to use it in an imatative way, such that I could analyze an authors works, and copy the general sentence structure that they use. This so I could tell a story, in chapters, through different authors "styles" so to speak. It is something that has been bouncing around in my head, and I will continue to think on it. 

## Tech stuff 

Uploading another image at a manageable size, but mostly focused on experimenting with voyant at this time.
