# Things I learned today 

## General stuff

- the fluid text websites are interesting, I quite like the way that they format the revisions, and it makes me wish that I could have the same capabilities for my own writing. It would seem to be quite a bit easier when going back and forth on which sentence sounds better where.

## Tech stuff

- No big tech stuff this week for me.
