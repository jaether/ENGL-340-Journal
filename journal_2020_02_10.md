## Things I have learned today 

I learned how to utilize CSS by creating an internal reference within my project-folder. 

As I was *not* at class for Februrary 17th 2020, I am adding my thoughts on the assignment for that within this journal. I was able to succesfully create both shell scripts, and had fun in doing so. I enjoy the collaborative aspect of our class greatly, but it felt good to be able to problem-solve by myself as well. However, I am excited to join back into the discussion now that we are beginning to tap into the roots of our computers. The ability to actually begin to interface with my computer in its language is so far interesting, and has already stirred some thoughts in me about computing and its relationship to the humanities.
