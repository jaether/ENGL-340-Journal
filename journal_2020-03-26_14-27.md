## general reflection 

The reading of Walden has been interesting. It appears Thoreau is moving onto more physical descriptions of the landscape counter-posed by extremely spiritual or philosophical musings and sentiments. I like this way of doing things, keeping the vastly abstract mediated by the vastly physical. In saying this, I feel the scale of Thoreau's project has intensified as well.
